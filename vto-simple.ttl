From the second IAO workshop, various comments, [commented on by Alan Ruttenberg 8/6/2009]

unit of measure is a quality, e.g. the length of a ruler.

[We decided to hedge on what units of measure are, instead talking about measurement unit labels, which are the information content entities that are about whatever measurement units are. For IAO we need that information entity in any case. See the term measurement unit label]

[Some struggling with the various subflavors of is_about. We subsequently removed the relation represents, and describes until and only when we have a better theory]

a represents b means either a denotes b or a describes

describe:
a describes b means a is about b and a allows an inference of at least one quality of b

We have had a long discussion about denotes versus describes."""@en ,
